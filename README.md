# test_merge_conflicts
Just a repo to test some merge conflicts

Test 1 - Create a file that gets merge conflicts by a copy that I don't want, then I will take git checkout --ours my_file.txt
to see if I still have to git add it or if it just gets removed from the index of conflicted files (add some unstaged files that are not part of the merge conflict)

Test 2 - Create a merge conflict where one of the two parties changes the directory name, and the same file's content
